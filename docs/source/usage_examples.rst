Usage Examples
==============

This section provides examples closer to real-world code and how to apply
pyChapel in such a context. The examples seek to illustrate the effort required
by the user and what results can be expected.

Finance
-------

One application domain is the use of machine-learning to determine the value of
a stock in the future based on previous market-behavior.
The structure of such a code can often be factored into three stages:

1. Load up asking and bidding prices of a stock over time
2. Apply quant-analysis
3. Visualize results

An example of such an application is provided below:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/test_finance_python_numpy.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 1-92

Where the computationally intensive part is the function
``quant``. Do note that the specific implementatio of the ``quant`` function
does not compute anytime meaningful.
Using ``pych`` this function can be mapped to Chapel by changing:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/test_finance_python_numpy.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 58-67

to:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/test_finance_chapel_numpy.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 60-72

and adding the include statement:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/test_finance_chapel_numpy.py
   :language: python
   :lines: 12-12

These two implementations can be executed by the commands::

  ./test_finance_python_numpy.py --filename=aux/GBPUSD1m.txt
  ./test_finance_chapel_numpy.py --filename=aux/GBPUSD1m.txt

Numbers
.......

The implementations were executed three times each and the average reported. The
machine executing was a laptop with 6GB of memory with an Intel i5-2410M
CPU @ 2.3Ghz CPU with two physical cores.

This specific example running on a laptop resulted in the following::

  NumPy: wall-clock ~26.7 seconds.
  NumPy+pyChapel: wall-clock average ~4.2 seconds.

Resulting in a speedup of times ~6.3.

Scientific Computing
--------------------

A common need for speed when working with Python are scientific codes. NumPy and
the SciPy stack provide a rich environment for scientific computing, and
different approaches exist to accelerate such code - with pyChapel, a new means
is provided.

The structure of a scientific code can often be factored into three stages:

1. Load a data-set
2. Process the data
3. Visualize results

An example of such an application is provided below:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/test_python_synthetic_numpy.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 1-47

where the time-consuming, computational expensive, and memory hungry portion of
the application is the data-processing performed in the `simulation` function.

When tasked with increasing the throughput of such applications the user can
either choose to port the entire application to another language, write a Python-extension implemented in a lower-level language such as C, or call into library-functions implemented in lower-level languages for a subset of the application.

Using pyChapel, a subset of the application can with little effort be rewritten
such as the example below illustrates:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/test_chapel_synthetic_numpy.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 1-50

These two implementations can be executed by the commands::

  ./test_chapel_synthetic_numpy.py --tsteps 50 --particles 50000000
  ./test_python_synthetic_numpy.py --tsteps 50 --particles 50000000

The following subsection provides a couple of preliminary performance numbers.

Numbers
-------

The implementations were executed three times each and the average reported. The
machine executing was a laptop with 6GB of memory with an Intel i5-2410M
CPU @ 2.3Ghz CPU with two physical cores::

  NumPy: wall-clock ~28.3 seconds, ~2.2GB memory consumption.
  NumPy+pyChapel: wall-clock average ~8.8 seconds, ~1.5GB memory consumption.

Resulting in a speedup of ~ times 3.2 and a significantly lowered memory consumption.

C-Implementation
................

.. todo:: Add OpenMP to the c-implementation to compare and illustrate how close this performance gain is to an error-prone c-implementation.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/test_c_synthetic_numpy.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 1-68
